This application was done for ConUHacks by a team of 4
We wanted to develop a data visualization tool where people could see weather trends in the USA
as well as the historical data of Tsunami's and Earthquakes around the world.

We wanted to inform, and educate people all about the natural disasters frm around the world.

We used the historical data from NOAA using the Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery.
We then plotted and processed the data on our end.

To run "python server.py"
And the rest will be taken care of for you
